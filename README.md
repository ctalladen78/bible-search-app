## Parking Lot Items

 * Bookmark section shows date of last activity
 * Reading history
 * Home page shows inspiring images and verses


## How to use this template
*This is the contents of the www/ folder in Ionic
*This template does not work on its own*. It is missing the Ionic library, and AngularJS.

To use this, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy and paste this into an existing Cordova project and download a release of Ionic separately.
